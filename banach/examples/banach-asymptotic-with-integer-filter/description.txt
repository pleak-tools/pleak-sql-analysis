example a has  10 rows in table t11 and  10 rows in table t12
example b has  20 rows in table t11 and  20 rows in table t12
example c has  40 rows in table t11 and  40 rows in table t12
example d has 640 rows in table t11 and 640 rows in table t12 (16 times that of example c)

The multiplicity of each join key remains at 1 (i.e. it is a primary key).

Thus the sensitivity does not increase when the number of rows increases
but the query result increases proportionally to the number of rows,
so the relative error from noise is inversely proportional to the number of rows.
