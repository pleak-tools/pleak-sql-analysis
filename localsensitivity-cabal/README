# SQL local sensitivity analysis tool for pleak.io

Building for the first time:
    cabal sandbox init
    cabal install --only-dependencies
    cabal configure
    cabal build

Later, only
    cabal build
is required to rebuild when files have changed.

If dependencies or project structure has changed then
    cabal install --only-dependencies
    cabal configure
    cabal build
may be necessary.

The executable file will be called by an external derivative sensitivity analyser from catalogue 'banach', so we do not provide direct running instructions here.
