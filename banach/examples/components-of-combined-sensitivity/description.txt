example a	Adding/removing rows sensitivity (c_1) dominates combined sensitivity w.r.t. t11
example b	Derivative Banach sensitivity (c_0) dominates combined sensitivity w.r.t. t11
example c	Global Banach sensitivity bound (gsb) dominates combined sensitivity w.r.t. t11

\epsilon = 0.2
\beta = 0.02
S = 4000
c_3 = 400
G_1 = S/c_3 = 10
1/(e*\beta) = 18.39
1/\beta = 50

Because 18.39 > 10, G_2 and G_3 exist and 10 < G_2 < 50 < G_3

table t11:
    D = 10

diff a/t11.nrm b/t11.nrm
3c3
< G: 10.0;
---
> G: 50.0;

In example a, c_1 dominates because G = 10 <= G_1.
In examples b and c, we change G to 50 which is between G_2 and G_3 thus either gsb or c_0 can dominate.

diff b/t11.db c/t11.db
4d3
< 101 2

Table t12 contains 4 rows with join key 101 but at most one row with each of the other join keys.
example c differs from example b by removing the row with join key 101.
This makes c_0 much smaller in example c.
