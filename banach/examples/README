To run the examples in the subdirectories,
first give execute permissions to the file sqlsa-quiet in the current directory (banach/examples):
    chmod a+x sqlsa-quiet
Then go to the subdirectory of the example, e.g.
    cd components-of-combined-sensitivity
and run the script runtests:
    sh ./runtests
(or give it the execute permission and then just execute ./runtests).

The description of each example is in the file description.txt in the subdirectory of the example.
