# SQL analysis tool for pleak.io

## Building

Building is most convenient with stack. Check the project out with git and in
the root project directory:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
stack build
```

And follow the instructions that stack provides.


## TODO

- [ ] Write `README.md`
- [ ] SQL abstract syntax (simplified language)
- [ ] Basic analysis support
- [ ] Concrete syntax
