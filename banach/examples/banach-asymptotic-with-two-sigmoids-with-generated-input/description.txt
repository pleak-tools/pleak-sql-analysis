The multiplicity of each join key is 1 (i.e. it is a primary key).

We change the precision parameter of sigmoids so that
both the error from using sigmoids instead of actual filters
and the sensitivity (and thus the error from added noise)
increase proportionally to the square root of the number of rows.

The query result increases proportionally to the number of rows,
so the total relative error is inversely proportional to the number of rows.
