Building for the first time:
    cabal sandbox init
    cabal install --only-dependencies
    cabal configure
    cabal build

The executable is created in the subdirectory dist/build/banach, thus to execute it:
    dist/build/banach/banach

Example: dist/build/banach/banach query.txt --epsilon 1.0 --beta 0.1, where query.txt contains the query description. The parameters wpsilon and beta are optional.

Later, only
    cabal build
is required to rebuild when files have changed.

If dependencies or project structure has changed then
    cabal install --only-dependencies
    cabal configure
    cabal build
may be necessary.
