typenames always refer to existing types, aren't used syntactically to
when creating new types, so lookup the type in the catalog here to
check it exists

for a simple type:
get an either [type error] type

if it is left error - want to attach the error to the typename
node. don't want to duplicate this error to the name node or the
parent node

if it is right type: send the type to the parent. don't want to
annotated the typename or the name with the type since this annotation
isn't applicable to either node type

TODO: add tests for cast which make sure there is only one type in the
tree when successful, and only one type error in the tree when the
typename isn't recognised
