Building for the first time:
    cabal sandbox init
    cabal install --only-dependencies
    cabal configure
    cabal build

The executable is created in the subdirectory dist/build/banach, thus to execute it:
    dist/build/banach/banach

Later, only
    cabal build
is required to rebuild when files have changed.

If dependencies or project structure has changed then
    cabal install --only-dependencies
    cabal configure
    cabal build
may be necessary.
