example a has   6 rows in table t11 and   9 rows in table t12
example b has  12 rows in table t11 and  18 rows in table t12
example c has  24 rows in table t11 and  36 rows in table t12
example d has 384 rows in table t11 and 576 rows in table t12 (16 times that of example c)

The multiplicity of each join key also increases proportionally to the number of rows, e.g.
    t11 of example a has 2 rows with join key 100
    t11 of example b has 4 rows with join key 100
    t11 of example c has 8 rows with join key 100
    t11 of example d has 128 rows with join key 100
    t12 of example a has 4 rows with join key 101
    t12 of example b has 8 rows with join key 101
    t12 of example c has 16 rows with join key 101
    t12 of example d has 256 rows with join key 101

Thus the sensitivity increases proportionally to the number of rows
but the query result increases quadratically in the number of rows,
so the relative error from noise is inversely proportional to the number of rows.
