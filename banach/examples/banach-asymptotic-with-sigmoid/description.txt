example a has  10 rows in table t11 and  10 rows in table t12
example b has  20 rows in table t11 and  20 rows in table t12
example c has  40 rows in table t11 and  40 rows in table t12
example d has 640 rows in table t11 and 640 rows in table t12 (16 times that of example c)

The multiplicity of each join key remains at 1 (i.e. it is a primary key).

Here we change the precision parameter of sigmoids so that
both the error from using sigmoids instead of actual filters
and the sensitivity (and thus the error from added noise)
increase proportionally to the square root of the number of rows.

The query result increases proportionally to the number of rows,
so the total relative error is inversely proportional to the number of rows.
